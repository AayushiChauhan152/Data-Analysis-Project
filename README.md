# Data-Analysis-Project
In this project I'm trying to analyze the used car prices from dataset available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data in order to predict the most probable car price.
It is mainly divided into four parts:-
- Data Wrangling

- Exploratory

- Model Development

- Model Review and Evaluation

# Softwares and Libraries Used:

 - Anaconda Distribution
- Jupyter Notebook

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Importing Modules

 - import numpy as np
 - import math
 - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
